# CLICK-AND-KILL-GAME

Different size of Blocks will be generated randomly and you have to click on them to get points. If any block crosses the bottom part of the window, you will lose health and when it crosses zero the game will end.


<-- will work on this game in future to make it more interactive and animated-->
